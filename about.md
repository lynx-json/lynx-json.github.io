title: About Lynx JSON

Lynx JSON is hypertext media type `application/lynx+json` (a Lynx document), and a related metadata media type `application/lynx-spec+json` (a Lynx specification), designed to represent and describe documents and the connections among them, with enough semantic detail to allow the development of client applications without imposing strict display constraints or unnecessary coupling between clients and servers. By reducing display constraints and coupling, developers have more freedom to create client applications that take better advantage of the unique characteristics of each platform and device.
